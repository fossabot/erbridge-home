After a hearty breakfast, a small group of the party headed out with newly
recruited companions, returning to the tomb where so many have already died. The
journey was accomplished with ease, and the reduced party quickly took to
exploring deeper.

Within, they discovered a pair of doors, sealed closed by mortar, and with the
aid of their henchmen, one door was unsealed. Within, they discovered a foul
creature of undeath, with a beard, bushy red and long, but devoid of any ring,
Fearsome as the creature was, they group made short work of it, quickly looting
the room before breaking down the second door.

Within the second room was another such creature, and though their blades struck
true, this monster seemed unconcerned with the wounds it bore. Before they could
react, the creature they had thought they had slain emerged behind them,
blocking their exit, and the two reached out, their foul touch reducing two
brave fighting women to withered husks. The aid of Pyros was called, and with
the power of his holy flaming club and the force of Tom's wizardly spells, the
two beasts were vanquished.

That night a funeral service was held for the fallen, after the group, having
found the end of the tomb but no sign of the promised beard ring, searched
carefully for some sign of hidden doors, or secret ways. There were none.

The next day, the four searched around the outside, suspecting there might be a
secret entrance elsewhere in the burial mound, and sure enough, as dusk fell,
Pauee the thief discovered a door hidden on the far side from the main entrance.
Pushing the door ajar, Pauee let out a great shriek, her hands turned black and
limp, and her once nimble fingers rendered useless.

Unperturbed, the group pressed on, and sure enough, within they found the black
stone ring they had been searching for, entombed with the skeletal remains of a
proud warrior.

A second night was spent within the musty halls of the dead before the group,
laden by their loot, made their way back to town. They soon noticed something
amiss. As they approached, the horizon glowed orange, an unusual sight, and it
soon became clear that the town of Red Port was ablaze.

The villagers of Ferrytown did not seem to welcome the weary adventurers back
from their journeys. In fact, they were treated with borderline hostility,
blamed for the blaze in the city caused by a great fireball from the sky earlier
that day. All decided this must be the work of Pyros, and few rejoiced at his
cleansing flames.

After depositing their loot and the ruined Pauee, the three with a thirst for
adventure this day headed to the shore to watch their lord's work. Upon arrival,
they heard the plight of a wealthy merchant called Merrik, whose daughter was
supposedly stranded in his town house amidst the blaze. Unable to turn down the
promise of wealth, and accompanied by a young man in search of glory, the group
headed into the city.

Thanks to the guidance of their employer's manservant Frederik, the search for
Maeve was hampered only by the quick blades of the cities brigands and
cut-purses who had descended upon the house. Upon their exit, accompanied by the
fair maiden, the group encountered what Maurak determined to be an elemental
being of fire, which quickly consumed the mansion, thankfully devoid of the
adventurers who were rowing back across the river, feeling empowered by the
works of their god.

Rewarded for the return of Maeve with an amulet engraved with ancient script,
and laden with mounds of treasure, the party retired for the evening to count
their coins and plan their next actions. The sun set opposite the glowing
inferno that marked the last day of Red Port on the 59th day of Frosshar.
