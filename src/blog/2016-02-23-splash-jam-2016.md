Over the weekend, me and 100 other game developers took a cruise ship through
the Norwegian fjords to make a [bunch of games](https://itch.io/jam/splash16)
during a crazy thing called [Splash Jam](http://www.splash-jam.com/).

It wasn't until I landed in Tromsø and started working out where to go next that
I realized how far north we were. Well above the Arctic Circle and deep in the
frozen north.

The event started with structured "mingling" in a very dark room, and the theme
announcement: _beginnings_. Groups formed up and started brainstorming ideas. My
team: [Will McMain](https://twitter.com/WillR1ker),
[Aaron Oostdijk](https://twitter.com/aaronvark),
[Malena Klaus](https://twitter.com/dasmalle),
[Valdemar Andreasen](https://twitter.com/fauxvaldemar), and myself (later to be
dubbed _Silent Panda_); decided to try and make a game about the awkward
interactions you have when you meet someone for the first time.

Our first idea was about a sort of dancing game, where the players had to share
controls in some way to execute the dance. Then we had the idea of simulating an
awkward conversation using two phones with multiple choice conversation prompts.
We then moved towards a game where players had to use the vibration motors in a
game controller to communicate with each other. This last idea stuck and we
started playing around with ways to use that. By the end of the night, we had
decided to make a four player game, where two players hold one controller behind
their back and face away from the screen, while the other two guide them around.
The two with the controller would be able to use the vibration motors to
communicate with each other (Xbox controllers have separate motors in each
handle which spin at different frequencies). We also played with the idea of
having both pairs hold controllers and use vibration to communicate between the
groups.

Then we got on the boat.

By the morning, we had changed from two "teams" to two players with an audience.
The players would still share a controller with their backs to the screen, and
the audience's job would be to guide the players through a series of puzzles
that only they could see. Vibration would be used to provide feedback to the
players about their actions being out of sync.

Aaron started building a procedural music composer based on
[_In the Hall of the Mountain King_ by Edvard Grieg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r__Dk4oWGJQ)
(Norwegian, and the theme music for
[Alton Towers](https://www.altontowers.com/) - appropriate for the rollercoaster
ride the ship would put use through both evenings...). Valdemar started
designing some puzzles around ideas we'd discussed, and the rest of us started
building them.

Around dinner time, the boat left the fjords, and so began the terrible sickness
that killed all hope of game development for most of the teams...

A bit before dinner on the second day, we tested what we'd built so far (much
too late...), and discovered that it wasn't working. The interaction was much
too one sided, and the players just felt like bad voice recognition controllers
for the audience. We had built a lot of different mechanics by that point, but
all of them would have the same problem; the players didn't know anything the
audience didn't already know better. We needed to make some drastic changes.

We still liked the asymmetry of the players and the audience, and of the hidden
information. We wanted to continue to use the vibration motors as feedback
mechanisms for the players, and to keep them in the dark about each other's
movements.

So, what if the players are actually blind people, and rather than trying to
solve arbitrary puzzles, they're looking for treasure. Each of them has a metal
detector which vibrates their side of the controller. But they're not walking
along an empty beach, they're in a minefield. And so, _Blindfield_ was born.

We had about an hour before dinner, and after that we had another stretch of
open sea to cross, but we battled through the nausea, and constructed a game.

![Blindfield in Play](/assets/blog/splash-jam-2016/blindfield-in-play.jpg)

In [_Blindfield_](/games/blindfield/), two players hold a controller behind
their backs, and stand so they can't see the screen. An audience watches from
somewhere they _can_ see the screen, but not what the players are doing with the
controls.

Each player controls a coloured circle on the screen. They both have metal
detectors that work in different ways. One of them has a long range detector
that vibrates when they are moving in the direction of the treasure, but gets
weaker as it gets closer. The other has a short range detector that gets
stronger, the closer it gets to the treasure. When both players are standing on
the treasure, they win.

The audience's job is to guide the two players, to help them find each other
without stepping on any mines.

You can download it [here](https://silentpanda.itch.io/blindfield), but you'll
need at least 3 people (preferably more).

In retrospect, we should have started testing the game much earlier. What we
ended up with has promise, but it's pretty rough, and it needs something to keep
both players entertained throughout. Currently, one player looks around for the
treasure, while the other just sits there waiting. Then the audience guides the
second player to the general area the first thinks the treasure is in, and they
search around for a strong signal, and the first player gets guided to them, and
(hopefully), they win. While one player is active, the other is passively
waiting for instructions, which is fine when they're both experienced players,
but with novices, it can take some time for them to work out where they should
go.

![Even More Fjords](/assets/blog/splash-jam-2016/even-more-fjords.jpg)

Game jam aside, the fjords were things of beauty. The rooms we were working in
had a direct view out over the water, which provided plenty of distractions, and
some people saw the northern lights, which sounded amazing (I missed them...).
On top of that, the food on the boat was delicious, and we were "treated" to
traditional freeze dried fish and cod liver oil on the deck at some point on the
first day.

Above all, the people I met on the trip were all really lovely. I didn't manage
to talk to everyone (101 people is a lot), but I hope I've made some lasting
connections (or even friends!).

10 / 10, would jam again!
