# 19th Samonios...

The others have been and gone to the temple a few times. I think Cumhu is sick,
but I've been too busy to pay attention. I've barely put that book I found down.
Waltin seemed to have been studying the Dragontorcs for a long time and has
collected a lot of information about them. I didn't understand a lot of his
notes, but it looks like there used to a be a race of men ruled by the men who
rode on the backs of dragons, commanded by the power of their torcs! He seemed
to think one of the kings was buried in the tomb. There was a headless corpse in
the main tomb. Perhaps it used to bear one of these necklaces. We need to go
deeper. Imagine commanding the power of dragons!

# 20th Samonios...

Peno's got a guest coming from Conwe. Lord Mori, cousin to the King. Too high
born to be here searching for me, but I don't want be around when he's here.
Peno wants us to provide security while he's here. I'll stick the shadows like I
know.

He's also got a missing shipment from his lumber camp in the north. The others
want to investigate, but I'm not so sure. Peno pays us whatever we do, and the
tombs are where the Dragon Kings are. We should be heading down again. Alas...

# Later...

What a waste of time.

The men in the north are being tormented by forest spirits. Erix healed one
who'd been riddled with masses of splinters, and we told them to chop the wood
further out, before heading back with the missing shipment. Thankfully the
others have seen sense, and we plan to head back to the tomb tomorrow.

# 21st Samonios...

It rained heavily today, making the passage down to the caves treacherous and
slippery. I slid down, bruising my hip. The others lead me through familiar
passageways to some newly explored ones. They had told me of some sort of
abomination, made of the sown together bodies of the pale men. We found its lair
a tiny room full of stinking pools of bodily waste. It reminded me of the slave
pits, but far far worse.

Onwards, we entered a room were I found a section of loose stones. Pulling them
out, I uncovered a narrow tunnel leading to another wall of loose stones. The
room opened up into a large room with vaulted ceilings and a smaller walled
section ahead, but Babar decided he wouldn't fit through the tunnel, so we
turned back, instead heading through a door barricaded from the outside by
detritus. I told the others to leave it be, but they didn't want to listen.
Pulling apart the blockage, Babar lead the way.

The first thing I noticed was the stench of fresh blood. It brought flashes of a
memory I wanted to forget, covered in blood. Who knew a man had so much blood in
him... The room contained what looked like a strange kitchen of some kind, but
covered floor to ceiling in wet blood. The others had ventured in more readily
than I and hardly a moment had passed before Babar was shouting and swinging has
sword about. He was fighting a cloud of blood, and for each blow he dealt to it,
a cloud of blood poured from his skin to merge with the foul magic. Somehow,
together we managed to disperse the cloud before it could take a life, but Babar
looked pale and sickly after his ordeal. Thankfully it wasn't all for nothing.
The shelves were stocked with magic potions and a couple of poisons which I have
kept for later. One can never be too prepared...

Amongst the potions was one to cause invisibility, or so Neve said. I pocketed
that one, but gave the others to the group. Together we are stronger than the
sum of our parts. I remember Erlend telling me that an age ago. I think I'm
beginning to understand what he meant.

With the bloody room, we had reached another dead end, and so we headed back
around, ignoring my hard won tunnel once more. Babar looked a lot skinnier after
being drained, but the others wouldn't be persuaded. Instead we continued on
until we came to a pair of large bronze doors bearing a giant horned demon. A
woeful sign, but through the doors we went, and beyond lay a room covered in
wall carvings of great battles and dragon riders! We were going the right way.
The Dragon Kings must have lived or died in these halls, and with them would be
their treasure.

Just ahead stood a huge statue of a winged beast, and upon its head sat a crown,
encrusted with rubies. Over its head was strung a rope. Someone else had tried
to get that crown before us, but I wouldn't be perturbed. There were some
corpses of tiny creatures that the other recognised. They were strange hairy
things, and they had apparently been flattened by something. That should have
been a hint as to what was coming next. In fact I think the others took that
hint, as they prepared for battle, but I did my part, climbing the ladder left
behind. I hooked the crown in one swing of the grappling hook Erix had brought
with her, but before I could pull it from the statue's head, a stone fist had
reached up to pull the rope from my hands. I wasted no time in retreating to the
shadows, but the others ignored my protests and charged into battle. I didn't
expect any survivors, but the battle raged on, and soon there were cheers of
success. The others took my behaviour for cowardice. Sense is not cowardice. I
risked my life for that crown, but the others won't let me near it. I think
they've taken me for a thief, but when have I ever stolen from them? I'm sure
they will see sense.

Behind where the statue once stood, was a large mural of some kind of star. The
others recognised it as the one of the holy symbol belonging to the pale woman
they have imprisoned in Peno's tower. Perhaps this is the ancient religion of
the Dragon Kings. I must find out more about it.

I'm glad I had paid attention to Killia's tricks before he disappeared, because
we came to a locked door, and the others all turned to me to open it. It was
easier in practise than I remembered, even without the tools he'd used. Neve
gave me a pin she used to hold her hair up, and in a moment, the door was open.
Beyond stood a small statuette wearing the face of the horned demon on the large
doors we entered through. On either side stood skeletons stripped of all their
bones save their skull and spines. One of the magic users noticed their
unnatural aura, not that anyone needed magic to tell then something was off with
them.

We moved into the corridor and Neve blasted one of them with her magic and the
strange construct slithered towards us, like a snake. Weapons swung in unison,
and despite some of the blades glancing off the bones, they seemed to do some
damage. That was until the creature began to writhe like the snake of a snake
charmer I once saw in a market. It was strangely beautiful, but I tore my gaze
from it. Many of the others seemed entranced, though. Only Babar, Erix, the boar
and I were left to fight. The battle raged for what seemed like hours, though
was more like minutes, but finally we emerged victorious. To the victor goes the
spoils. We took the statuette and behind it lay a magical dagger. I wonder what
fell ritual was once enacted in that room...

The next door opened with ease to reveal a great statue of a griffon. A plaque
with another riddle was attached to its base, engraved in some ancient language,
but one of the others seemed to be able to read it. The answer was obvious, and
while the rest discussed what to do about it, I fired one of my arrows at the
griffon. The head of the arrow sunk deep into its chest, and its head lifted up
as if on a spring. Within was a finely crafted arrow. The others said it was
enchanted with death magic, but they couldn't say what effect it would have,
which means it is powerful. I could see them looking to take it away from me. I
don't know why they don't trust me, but I quickly tied it to my forearm. I won't
let them take all of the treasures for themselves. I had earned this one.

Babar looked about ready to collapse, so we headed back to town to rest, but not
before salvaging the griffon statue and the glass vials and apparatus from the
bloody room. On the way back, Cullen took me aside and handed me the magical
dagger we had found. Perhaps they don't all distrust me...
