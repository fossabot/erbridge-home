The party woke up from a particularly vivid shared dream to find their coin
purses (much) heavier, and a number of magical items in their possession. None
of them mentioned this stroke of luck, preferring not to question the generosity
of the gods.

Morak and Harold were nowhere to be found, but, by a stroke of luck, a weary
traveller had arrived at the inn that morning - a thief named Mordy - who chose
to join the rich looking adventurers in their quest without hesitation.

They started the day by finding a place to hide the sacks of gold that had
magically appeared overnight and remained unquestioned. A small underground
stream exit was found to be suitable and many, many gold pieces were left in the
safekeeping of some nameless but benevolent water god, along with a worthless
longsword.

Returning to town, they petitioned the local holy men for what aid they might
provide, and acquired a healing potion and some holy water. The smith's attempts
to build the flamethrower had met with failure, but he promised to attempt it a
second time. The two magic users exchanged spellbooks for a time, and it was
soon nightfall again.

In the morning the group reunited with the three Riks: Erik, Jorik and Rik.
Turmerik, the last surviving mercenary remained behind. The three Riks noticed a
difference in the quality of equipment the adventurers carried and demanded a
pay rise, which was granted. It did them little good in the end.

Beset by rats (yes, giant rats) and a ghoul, the party managed to steal the
contents of the tomb of King Ulrik I, but not before: awakening a pair of
guardian statues, smashing them to pieces, along with everything else in the
tomb, but not before they could kill two of the Riks; killing the third Rik
themselves (for good measure); and burning the king's corpse, as well as that of
the poor broken adventurer they had found there. The reward: a heap of gold, a
magical war hammer, a ceremonial longsword and plate armour, and a golden
crowned helm that they were expressly told _not to touch_.

Taking their loot back to town, Charles headed straight to Gunthrik to tell him
all about the naughty things they'd been doing in the tomb he held sacred, and
Gunthrik proceeded to interrogate them (yet more cries of "sacrilege"), during
which the last Rik abandoned his post. Things looked like the might have got
nasty, had Tom not managed a reasonable lie, aided by Mordy's plan to hide the
helm they _weren't supposed to have touched, let alone stolen_, and persuaded
the warrior priest that they'd found the tomb like that, honest. Gunthrik bought
it, but remained suspicious of the party. The party vowed to never let Charles
speak to important people again.
