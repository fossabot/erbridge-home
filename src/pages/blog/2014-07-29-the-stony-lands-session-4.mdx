Morak and Harold returned after being woken up on the side of a hill by Ruarc
and a band of mercenaries who were previously employed by a now missing
archaeologist known as Merfidius. Charles took an immediate liking to the
brutish woman called Mog, and while the others discussed terms of employment for
the rest, the innkeeper looked worriedly at the ceiling beams.

After agreeing on rates, the party headed back to the tomb, bolstered by new
blood. It appeared much as they'd left it, until Harold, the lantern bearer,
tripped over a trip wire and dropped a mass of blankets on the heads of the
party's main fighting force. Beset by hobgoblins, goblins and fire beetles, and
having lost many, the party turned to what they knew best: fire. Remembering
their patron, Pyros, they made short work of the remaining opponents. Charles
mourned the death of his betrothed.

Heading on, the party came, at last, to the quarry they sought: the goblin king,
or so they assumed. Two flaming flasks later, the room was ruined, and those
within it, slain. The party collected its prize: the hobgoblin's crown, a pair
of silver bracers, a jewelled torc, and a mighty looking battleaxe; and bid
farewell to Forsyth the Annoying, who sadly perished in the flames.

Lighting a funeral pyre, the party gathered for marshmallows, before heading
back to town, to claim their reward from Gunthrik, who seemed fairly pleased to
finally be done with them at last, and so handed them the “shield that deflects
all blows” with great reverence before telling them to piss off.
