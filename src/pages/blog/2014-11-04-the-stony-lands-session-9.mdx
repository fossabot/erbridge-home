On the evening of the Fall of Red Port, the group slept fitfully, their dreams
disturbed by visions of horror. They dreamed of another place. A place where
they awoke, cold to their bones and lying on sand. The silence was only
disturbed by the rustle of their armour, as they stirred.

Looking about, they discovered themselves to be in the centre of a circle of
blood, soaked into the sand. A larger circle of stone enclosed them in its
walls, smooth, as if hewn from a solid piece of rock and stretching high above
them to a domed ceiling, illuminated by a mysterious ghostly light emanating
from their weapons and armour. In the centre of the circle, the pommel of a
sword broke the surface, and after some careful work, it was unburied, revealing
a sword of black glass buried to the hilt in the sand. No sooner had the blade
been pulled from the sand, than deep chanting filled the air, and strange
spirits appeared to encircle the group, moving as if time was sped up for them.
Moments later, the visions were gone, and silence returned.

Entrusting the sword to young Iraitz, a hero in the making, who had been brought
along with them to this place, the group steeled themselves, and stepped from
within the circle, finding no harm to come to them.

Ahead lay a short corridor ending in a cell of sorts, its iron portcullis bent
apart as if by a creature of great strength and size, but nothing more was to be
found. Instead the group headed up the spiral ramp leading out of the pit,
pausing as a cold wind blew down at hem, bringing with it the sensation of
invisible people brushing past them.

At the top of the ramp stood a hideous statue. A naked man with the head of a
rat bore down on the party, his stone flesh covered in boils and sores, wretched
with disease, and in his hand he held a long whip, ridged like the tail of a
rat. Beyond, the corridor opened up into a room with chains attached to the
walls, and an iron kris knife on a table, which Tom claimed for himself.

The next room held a strange circle of runes engraved into the floor, though the
text seemed to evade attempts to read it. As the party examined this oddity, a
blood curdling scream echoed down the corridors behind them, causing them to
turn back on themselves and explore further.

Taking the third exit from the room with the chains, the group were confronted
with a stone door. Pushing it open, a strong, cold wind blew around the seal,
bringing with it the sounds of speeded up voices. William, who had taken up
position at the back, felt something pass through him, bringing with it
wrenching pain. Turning he was faced with a strange shimmering humanoid
silhouette, with elongated blade-like fingers, which swooped back in, for
another strike, depleting the elf's strength, and bringing him to the brink of
death. Rallying, the group blasted the creature with spell and sword, finding
only the blade of black glass to be of any strong effect, and soon it fled away
from them back where it had come from.

Returning to the magic circle after a short rest, the group decided to leave it
be for now, heading up the stairs exiting the room to find a great stone door,
sealed shut and surrounded by glowing, but unreadable runes. Try as they might,
the door would not be opened, so they instead headed downwards.

After a steep descent, the group found themselves presented with a large stone
hall, pillars holding up a vaulted roof, and more rat-faced statues looking down
on them from a barred alcove above. As they passed through, they were beset by
the sensation of being watched. Beyond stood a library, filled with unreadable
books, though the illustrations suggested tomes on the topics of necromancy and
disease and each book had he symbol of a rat encircled by its tail on inside
cover. Despite their blurred text, William collected two he decided would be the
most valuable, and the group made to move on. As they did, the pages of the
discarded books fluttered open, and a ghostly figure appeared, leafing through
one volume after another, before disappearing once more.

Heading through a door, the party entered a space colder than the rest, what
looked to be the quarters of the librarian, long abandoned to dust and
disrepair. As the group paused in the next room, a room once dedicated to study,
the sound of muttering from nearby disturbed them, followed by the sound of
slamming doors and more of the speeded up speech. Moments later, the ghostly
form reappeared, and the party set upon it. Their blessed water and silver
weapons had no effect on the creature of shadow. Only items of magic caused it
any real harm, and the battle was lead by Iraitz, who turned the spectre once
more.

Taking only a moment to pause the rest, the party continued onwards and were
presented with a room with a bloody altar and a large mirror of black glass.
Looking into the mirror, the unremarked upon newcomer, a rogue of small
intelligence, was confronted by a shadowy form, which emerged from its black
surface and reached out to strike him. What followed was a battle of blade and
wit, as the party struck the creature, while attempting to smash the mirror from
whence it had come. At last the creature fell, but at the cost of the life of
Iraitz, whose very being had been pulled into that impervious and dark surface.

With the creature vanquished, the party set to the task of their escape from
those halls. Having discovered no further exits, they set to attempting to smash
the mirror in earnest and discovered that the black blade, when striking its
mirrored kin, merged with its surface, only to reform once more, when withdrawn.
After much discussion and experimentation, which cost the unremarkable rogue his
life, the group came to the realization that perhaps the key to smashing the
mirror was to smash the sword that was its kin.

Taking the sword in both hand, William brought it crashing down onto the stone
altar, and sure enough, cracks spread through the blade of glass. Touching it to
the mirror, the cracks spread out to the mirrored glass, and with a strike of a
hammer on the pane, the mirror shattered at last. With a cry, the dreamers awoke
as one. All but Iraitz, whose breath had stopped in the night. Amongst their
belongings, they found two tomes, their text vanished, but the illustration
remaining, a wicked dagger of iron, and a carefully drawn map of a place they
had never been to.
