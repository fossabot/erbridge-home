We're making a game!

Ok, I already [said that](/blog/welcome-to-the-island), but after some thought,
and some good advice, we shelved _The Island_. We hadn't made much progress on
it, and we decided it was too big an idea for our small team of two. Instead,
[Luke](https://www.luketovee.com/) and I decided to try to create something more
manageable.

So we came up with _Skald_, an ambitious game about going on a journey and
telling stories.

You play as a Viking traveller, sailing the rivers and coastlines of
Scandinavia. On your journey, you'll meet people, and to pass the time, you'll
exchange stories. And by "telling stories", I don't mean multiple choice
dialogues. I'm talking about text boxes with free form writing. Your companion
will tell you a story, and you'll be given the opportunity to respond to it with
one of your own. If your story is a good one, they might tell you something
interesting. If not, they might decide to find something else to occupy their
time.

Beneath this is an exploration game. You've set out on a journey to find
something you care about, be it your father's killer or a lost heirloom. The
people you meet can give you clues as to where to go next, as well as hints of
other things to do, but only if you can impress them with a story that jogs
their memory. At the same time, you need to eat, and travelling through the
rocky, icy water can be dangerous, and your boat can get damaged. To pay for
food and repairs, you can pick up paying passengers, but they might not share
your destination. Do you take a detour, because you need the money, but risk
that your quarry gets further away, or do you set sail with a damaged boat and
risk sinking it?

The hope is that the game will become a fun way to engage people in creative
writing, by layering storytelling on a game that tightly integrates with the
stories you tell.

Updates to come!
