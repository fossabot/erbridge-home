# The Great Wound (Part II)

### Robinson Jeffers

The mathematicians and physics men\
Have their mythology; they work alongside the truth,\
Never touching it; their equations are false\
But the things work. Or, when gross error appears,\
They invent new ones; they drop the theory of waves\
In universal ether and imagine curved space.\
Nevertheless their equations bombed Hiroshima.\
The terrible things worked.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The poet also\
Has his mythology. He tells you the moon arose\
Out of the Pacific basin. He tells you that Troy was burnt for a vagrant\
Beautiful woman, whose face launched a thousand ships.\
It is unlikely: it might be true: but church and state\
Depend on more peculiarly impossible myths:\
That all men are born free and equal: consider that!\
And that a wandering Hebrew poet named Jesus\
Is the God of the universe. Consider that!

# The Groaning Worm (Part II)

### erbridge

The magicians and phonetic monsters\
Have their ministries; they waste alongside the terror,\
Never tasting it; their exhortations are faltering\
But the Thanes wait. Or, when grave energies align,\
They incant nefarious witchcraft; they dowse the threads of worlds\
In unifying enchantments and invoke cruel stanzas.\
Nevertheless their exhortations became Hell.\
The terrifying Thanes waited.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The priest also\
Has his ministry. He teaches you the messengers arrived\
Out of the piercing black. He teaches you that Terror was built for a violent\
Baleful worm, whose feelers laced a threadless shell.\
It is unknown: it might be terrible: but chirurgeons and storytellers\
Deliver on more presciently informative mysteries:\
That all monsters are birthed flesh and entrails: commiserate that!\
And that a worrisome hellfire priest née Judas\
Is the guardian of the unification. Commiserate that!
